First of all I would like to give credits to ElKoax for the axon source and I would like to credit Mellon for the banger addys :)

-- CHANGELOG --

Not much has been done except
- Added DrawingLIB / Drawing API
- Added garbage collection (basically it helps with your game crashing)
- Cleaned the source a bit and added // comments so you can know what to do for certain things.

ty ElKoax and Mellon!


-- POLISHED AXON --

This is basically buffed, but beter.
enjoy, works perfectly fine :)
